## Other potentially useful resources 

# ML 
+ https://mlcontests.com/cloud-gpu compiles a list of cloud GPU resources. When I can afford it, I would like to consider Genesis Cloud because they claim to be fully powered using renewable energy. They also offer a wide range of GPUs (sometimes I really only need a bit of GPU).

# Robotics
+ ROS 2 (Migration guide): https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Guides/Launch-files-migration-guide.html
